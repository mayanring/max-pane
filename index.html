        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
        And sorry I could not travel both<br />
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
        And looked down one as far as I could<br />
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        </p>

        <p>
        Then took the other, as just as fair<br />
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
        Though as for that the passing there<br />
        Had worn them really about the same,
        </p>

        <p>
          And both that morning equally lay<br />
          In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
          Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
          Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
          I doubted if I should ever come back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
          Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
          Two roads diverged in a wood, and I â€”<br />
          I took the one less traveled by,<br />
          And that has made all the difference.

        <h1>Walden</h1>
        <p>
          I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,<br />
          to front only the essential facts of life,<br />
          and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br />
          and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
